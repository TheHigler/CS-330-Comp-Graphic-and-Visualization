How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

  When designing software I always start with the requirements of the project as these will be the blueprint that I must follow to ensure customers are happy. I'll use this to also create comments within code to make sure any requirements aren't forgotten. Unfortunately for me, due to life, I really fell apart with this course and didn't give myself the opportunity to develop, or craft, any real additional skills. Because I couldn't give this class the attention it needed or that I wanted, I didn't follow any worthwhile design processes. What I would have done though is, separate out some of the functions to create a cleaner code environment. The most notwworthy being the shape generation. Most of my project was comprised of a plethora of vertices and indices which really muddied up the code. Having all of those in it's own class, outside of the source.cpp, would have created much cleaner code. It also would have allowed me to manipulate and shade them all more efficiently. 

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

  Generally when approaching software development, I will use code comments to keep me on track and ensure I tackle all of the obejectives. I think the most notable development strategy I learned while working on this project would be to revisit the learning material often, do more research on aspects I'm struggling with, and ask questions sooner. While bouncing between the supplied code from the course and the code material given in the resources/tutorials/videos, it furthered my understanding of how, why, and where certain things should be placed. Through trial and error I was able to understand what the URender() and UCreateMesh() functions were doing and their purpose within the code. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

  Computer science will help me find a career I may not dread waking up to go to everyday and better provide for my family. I love solving problems and feel in this line of work I will be able to solve a new kind of problem most days. Computational graphics and visualization gave me a taste of what math can really do within the programming world. I thougt linear algebra was a nonsensical class until week two of this class where I saw how that knowledge can really shine. I'm not sure what knowledge computational graphics and visualization gave me that can be applied to my professional pathway but, it did create a potential new hobby. While I struggled a lot with this class, once things started clicking into place, I was having a lot of fun generating my scene. I don't think I would wnat to do it in any sort of professional manner but, I will certainly explore it in my spare time.
